# DVR

DVR interface for fun

## Usage

This is an exploratory design of a DVR system

## Background Information

The DVR takes input from the user for recording priorities, and schedule, and
matches this against the tv schedule.

Its a relatively naive system, if there are tuners that are available for
recording, it records. 



```
rake        # run test suite
